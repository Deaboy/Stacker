# Stacker
A quick game project thrown together and completed in a single evening using Lua and Love2D

# Compilation
1. Download/install the Love2D framework from their site at (https://www.love2d.org/)[https://www.love2d.org/]
2. Download this repository as a zip file
3. Use Love2D to open the zip file you downloaded (I just dragged and dropped the zip file onto a shortcut to Love)

If you're having issues running it, try unzipping the file, then opening the unzipped folder with Love. *Make sure
the file `main.lua` is in the root of the folder you're trying to open, not inside a subfolder!*
