# Stacker
A quick game project thrown together and completed in a single evening using Lua and Love2D

# Compilation
1. Download/install the Love2D framework from their site at [https://www.love2d.org/](https://www.love2d.org/)
2. Download this repository as a zip file
3. Use Love2D to open the zip file you downloaded (I just dragged and dropped the zip file onto a shortcut to Love)

If you're having issues running it, try unzipping the file, then opening the unzipped folder with Love. Make sure
the folder you're opening contains the project's source code. You should see `main.lua` and other files immediately within the folder!
